BriefOps is a local-first CLI for AI coding agents with persistent memory, handoffs, and token-aware context.

The goal is not just to generate a good brief. The goal is to let a user finish an AI coding task, carry recent work into the next handoff immediately, promote useful items into directory-local durable memory, and start a fresh Codex or Claude Code thread where the same worker can continue with prior decisions, lessons, risks, and judgment profile.

```bash
briefops prime --task "Start the next task." --format codex --max-tokens 800
briefops finish ...
briefops continue --worker <worker> --task "<next task>" --pack
```

BriefOps does not run agents. It prepares deterministic local context for them.
It should not maximize context. It preserves continuity by selecting the smallest useful information that should survive into the next task.

## What BriefOps Is

- a local CLI
- a file-based skill, project, memory, worker, and work-log store
- a deterministic directory-local memory promotion workflow
- a token-aware brief, handoff, Codex mission, and resume generator
- a compact first-context primer for fresh Codex threads
- a persistent worker continuity layer for fresh AI coding threads
- router exports for local harnesses like Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor

## What BriefOps Is Not

BriefOps is intentionally scoped. It is not:

- an LLM client
- a vector database
- a SaaS product
- a web UI
- an agent runtime
- a multi-agent orchestrator
- a cloud sync service
- an MCP server

Everything important lives in local files under `.briefops/`.

BriefOps can generate Codex skill-plugin assets, but the plugin calls the local CLI and local `.briefops/` workspace. No hosted service or required marketplace is involved.

## BriefOps Relay — Build Week Preview

BriefOps Relay is the Build Week addition to this derivative repository. It
turns bounded repository evidence into a reviewable execution-contract loop:

```text
prepare evidence → validate contract/audit → integrity gate → handoff → static report
```

The currently shipped loop is deliberately API-key-free. It validates evidence
references, contract coverage, and a deterministic integrity score; the seeded
demo shows a context-drift violation before any model integration is enabled.

### 60-second offline demo

From a checkout of this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js relay demo
node dist/index.js relay audit --run latest
node dist/index.js relay handoff --run latest
node dist/index.js relay report --run latest
```

All artifacts are written beneath `.briefops/relay/runs/`. The demo requires
neither an API key nor network access. `report.html` is self-contained and can
be opened directly from the generated run directory.

Reproduce the seeded evaluation:

```bash
npm run relay:eval
```

The current fixture expects one violation (`C-001`) and verifies precision,
recall, and valid evidence-reference rate. Its scope is intentionally small;
it demonstrates the artifact-validation boundary rather than claiming a broad
benchmark.

### Prepare evidence for a real task

```bash
briefops relay prepare "Add bulk deletion support to the customer API" --dry-run
briefops relay audit --run latest --collect-diff
```

This produces a bounded manifest and line-addressable repository evidence while
excluding secret-bearing files; the second command captures hunk-level Git
evidence from the recorded baseline. The live semantic contract and diff
analysis path is available through an explicit provider and `--allow-network`.

### Semantic providers and authentication

Relay supports two explicit providers:

- `codex` uses the locally authenticated Codex CLI. Authenticate once with
  `codex login`; Relay then executes an ephemeral, read-only, schema-constrained
  Codex task. This path uses the user's Codex/ChatGPT entitlement rather than
  an API key.
- `openai` uses the Responses API with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `store: false`, and
  structured JSON output. It is available for teams that prefer a project API
  key and direct API observability.

Both live paths require an intentional network flag because bounded repository
evidence is sent to the chosen provider:

```bash
briefops relay prepare "Add bulk deletion support" --allow-network --provider codex
briefops relay audit --run latest --allow-network --provider codex
```

Use `--provider openai` only when a project API key is configured. Relay never
reads or exposes a Codex token; it delegates authentication to the installed
Codex CLI.

For the Build Week boundary and implementation record, see
[`PREEXISTING.md`](PREEXISTING.md) and [`BUILD_LOG.md`](BUILD_LOG.md).

## Release Status

BriefOps 2.2.0 is the current npm-ready release for developers who want a local-first memory and context ledger for AI coding agents. It packages the 2.1 Master Harness routing, continuity observability, strict release-readiness checks, evidence anchors, workspace-lock hardening, the fresh-thread environment gate that treats missing local CLI setup as `Status: setup-required`, runtime readiness checks for local plugin and prompt drift, and evaluation failures that exit nonzero.

The public CLI behavior and workspace file-format policy are documented in `docs/compatibility.md` and `docs/file-format.md`. The core safety principles are stable:

- local files first
- no hosted service required
- no required MCP server
- directory-local memory by default
- shared-only export controls
- deterministic CLI behavior

For privacy guarantees, see `docs/privacy-model.md`.

## Publishing And Sharing Boundary

Before publishing a repository or sharing generated context, review:

- `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting and local data handling.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development checks and safety rules.
- `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes.
- `docs/file-format.md` and `docs/compatibility.md` for the local data contract.
- `docs/privacy-model.md` for export-policy and local data boundaries.

## Use Cases And Workflows

BriefOps helps AI coding threads carry context across issue triage, pull request review, release readiness, incident follow-up, and long-running repository maintenance work.

- [Use Cases](docs/use-cases.md)
- [Repository Maintenance Workflows](docs/repository-maintenance-workflows.md)

## Install

From npm:

```bash
npm install -g briefops
briefops --version
```

From this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

Run during development without linking:

```bash
npm run dev -- --help
```

Check the CLI:

```bash
briefops --version
briefops --help
```

## 5-Minute Codex Quickstart

This is the primary BriefOps workflow.

BriefOps is a first-context gate for repos that opt into it. At the start of a fresh thread, verify the CLI before broad repo/history inspection:

```bash
command -v briefops >/dev/null 2>&1
```

If `briefops` is not on `PATH`, stop and report `Status: setup-required`. Do not continue by silently skipping BriefOps; install with `npm install -g briefops`, use `npx briefops@latest`, or explicitly continue from an already supplied Brief/Spec/Plan.

### 1. Initialize

```bash
briefops bootstrap
```

This creates a local `.briefops/` workspace, installs Codex first-context guidance into `AGENTS.md`, writes `.briefops/codex/prompts/`, installs the deterministic local plugin bundle under `.briefops/codex/plugin/briefops`, adds `.briefops/` to `.gitignore`, and runs bounded privacy/stability checks.

If you want the manual path instead:

```bash
briefops init
briefops codex install
briefops codex plugin install
briefops doctor --privacy --fix-gitignore
briefops doctor --stability
```

### 2. Create A Skill

```bash
briefops skill create risk-review \
  --description "Review changes for risk and governance violations" \
  --tags "review,risk,governance"
```

A skill is a reusable working protocol.

### 3. Create Project Context

```bash
briefops project create atlas-q \
  --description "Rule-based non-ML quantitative trading system" \
  --tags "quant,trading"
```

A project stores durable facts and constraints.

### 4. Create A Worker

```bash
briefops worker create quant-reviewer \
  --project atlas-q \
  --skills "risk-review" \
  --style "governance-first,no strategy drift without approval"

briefops worker use quant-reviewer
```

A worker is the persistent identity BriefOps carries across fresh threads: default project, skill bundle, style, lessons, risks, and judgment profile. `worker use` makes it the default worker for start-of-thread priming.

### 5. Prime A Fresh Codex Thread

```bash
briefops prime \
  --task "Review this PR for risk policy violations." \
  --format codex \
  --max-tokens 800
```

Paste the compact prime context into Codex first. Repos bootstrapped with BriefOps also get `AGENTS.md` guidance that tells Codex to run this before broad repo/history inspection.

Codex-format prime output includes an operating note for Codex: use the selected worker/project context, inspect only files needed for the task, treat `.briefops/` memory as local repo state, and ask before exporting private memory or applying skill patches.

### 6. Start A Codex Mission When Needed

```bash
briefops codex mission \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Review this PR for risk policy violations." \
  --mode loop \
  --completion-promise "Deliver verified findings and no unresolved blocking risk." \
  --save
```

Paste the generated mission prompt into Codex.

### 7. Finish The Task

When Codex finishes, record what happened:

```bash
briefops finish \
  --project atlas-q \
  --skill risk-review \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Review this PR for risk policy violations." \
  --result "Found missing turnover warning check." \
  --lesson "Verify turnover warning threshold when rebalance logic changes." \
  --decision "Treat unverified slippage assumptions as blocking before merge recommendation." \
  --open-risk "Slippage assumptions remain unverified." \
  --next-step "Continue the review and finish unresolved slippage checks." \
  --commands "npm test,npm run build"
```

`finish` always writes a work log when `--task` and `--result` are valid. If the log has no durable memory candidates, `finish` warns and still prints the next `briefops continue` command.

### 8. Local Memory Is Applied

`finish` applies durable memory candidates into `.briefops/memory/` by default and keeps the proposal file as an audit trail. The output reports how many memory items were created or skipped as duplicates.

Use review mode only when you explicitly want a pending local queue:

```bash
briefops finish --memory-review ...
```

Inspect, apply, or reject queued proposals when needed:

```bash
briefops memory proposal-show latest
briefops memory proposal-apply latest
briefops memory proposal-reject latest
```

### 9. Continue In A Fresh Thread

```bash
briefops continue \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Continue the review and finish unresolved slippage checks." \
  --pack
```

`continue --pack` checks continuity health, notes any optional pending memory proposals, refreshes worker intelligence, saves a handoff, saves a Codex resume prompt, saves a portable resume pack, and prints all generated paths.

## Shared-Only Export Path

Use shared-only output when context may leave the local terminal or local Codex session:

```bash
briefops prime --task "Continue unresolved checks." --format codex --export-policy shared-only
briefops pack resume --worker quant-reviewer --task "Continue unresolved checks." --export-policy shared-only
```

`shared-only` includes only memory items where `visibility: shared` and `exportable: true`.

It omits private memory, local project file details, raw work logs, open risks, local next steps, private worker lessons, private incidents, recent work history, and private metadata counts.

`local-private` is intended for local terminal/Codex use only and may include local private continuity context.

BriefOps may update directory-local memory during normal local work. Explicit confirmation is reserved for sharing private memory outside the workspace or applying skill patches.

## Local Harness Export

Generate local harness instruction files when you want Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor to know how to call BriefOps:

```bash
briefops export agents-md
briefops export claude-md
briefops export cursor-rules
briefops export all
```

Exports are routers, not memory dumps. They tell local AI tools to run `briefops prime`, `briefops finish`, and `briefops continue --pack`.

They do not copy `.briefops` memory, raw logs, private decisions, incidents, handoffs, or worker summaries into `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or Cursor rules. Export commands default to `--export-policy shared-only` because these files are often committed.

## Master Harness Routing

Use the Master Harness router when Codex should decide the smallest sufficient workflow before implementation:

```bash
briefops harness route --task "Fix the failing dashboard layout test."
briefops harness route --task "Build the release readiness flow." --type large-feature
briefops harness matrix
```

The router classifies work across bug fixes, features, refactors, dependency upgrades, UI changes, test repairs, incidents, documentation, architecture decisions, research, code review, and release preparation. It returns the required specification, planning, goal ledger, findings, verification, memory update, artifacts, exit criteria, and final response contract.

In 2.1.x this is a routing contract, not a forced process engine. Tiny fixes can stay light; release, incident, UI, and larger feature work can require evidence, findings, and handoff discipline.

See `docs/master-harness.md` for the Codex-compatible BriefOps Master Harness architecture and MVP plan.

## Context Minimalism

Inspect the built-in budget policy:

```bash
briefops inspect budget
```

Compare raw local candidate context to compact prime output:

```bash
briefops compare context --worker quant-reviewer --task "Review this PR."
```

BriefOps should not become the context bloat it was built to prevent. Use `prime` first, then generate a handoff or resume pack only when continuity needs more detail.

Inspect the live continuity signal for a worker:

```bash
briefops obs continuity --worker quant-reviewer --task "Review this PR." --json
```

This reports raw candidate context, compiled prime size, compression, continuity health, local queues, and memory hygiene signals without dumping private memory content.

## Memory Hygiene

Not every task deserves durable memory. Use durable memory for decisions, lessons, incidents, open risks, and reusable constraints:

```bash
briefops finish --importance trivial --task "Fix typo" --result "Fixed typo."
briefops finish --no-memory-proposal --task "Experiment" --result "Discarded."
briefops memory hygiene
briefops memory prune --dry-run
```

`memory hygiene` and `memory prune --dry-run` are read-only in this release. They report bloat, stale items, deprecated items, and duplicate-like memory without deleting anything.

## Privacy Check

Run this before publishing a repository, sharing a pack, or attaching BriefOps context outside your machine:

```bash
briefops doctor --privacy
briefops doctor --privacy --fix-gitignore
briefops doctor --stability
briefops doctor --strict --json
```

BriefOps is local-first, but `.briefops/` may contain private logs and memory. Keep `.briefops/` out of source control unless you intentionally curated the contents.

`doctor --privacy` checks local memory sharing hazards, including `.briefops/` gitignore coverage, private/exportable memory, and secret-like memory strings.

`doctor --stability` checks local workspace integrity, schema validity, duplicate memory ids, broken references, managed-path symlinks, and orphaned review artifacts. It keeps diagnostics bounded and does not add detailed doctor output to `prime`, handoff, resume, or pack context.

`doctor --strict` aggregates stability, security, privacy, and memory hygiene checks. Warnings keep `releaseReady` false in JSON output, which makes the command useful as a pre-release gate.

## Pre-Publish Readiness

Before `npm publish`, run the local release checks and review the package contents:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
npm pack --dry-run
npm run verify:release
```

Run `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` or `npm run verify:release` only from an environment where sending dependency metadata to the npm registry is acceptable.

Confirm:

- generated harness files are routers, not `.briefops` memory dumps
- `briefops --version` matches `package.json`
- `.briefops/` is ignored or intentionally curated
- `npm view briefops versions --json` does not already include the target version
- `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the release checklist reflect the shipped behavior
- `npm pack --dry-run` includes `dist`, docs, examples, plugins, README, LICENSE, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and CHANGELOG

## Harness Integrations

BriefOps works best as a local memory ledger beside stronger harnesses such as Codex, LazyCodex, OmO, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode. See `docs/integrations/harnesses.md`.

## Finish / Continue UX

`finish` records what happened.

It writes a work log, applies durable directory-local memory when the log contains useful candidates, keeps a proposal audit file, can propose a skill patch, can refresh the worker summary, and prints the next `briefops continue` command.

Recent work logs are available to the next local handoff immediately. Durable memory is the long-lived layer: lessons, decisions, incidents, and reusable rules are promoted locally by default unless `--memory-review` is used.

`continue` prepares the same worker for a fresh thread.

It inspects continuity health, notes optional pending memory proposals, refreshes the worker summary, generates a handoff, and saves a Codex resume prompt. Add `--pack` when you also want one self-contained markdown file.

```bash
briefops finish \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --project atlas-q \
  --skill risk-review \
  --task "Review rebalance logic." \
  --result "Found missing turnover warning check." \
  --lesson "Always verify turnover warning threshold." \
  --next-step "Continue unresolved slippage checks."

briefops continue \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Continue unresolved slippage checks." \
  --pack
```

You can continue even if older or review-mode memory proposals are still pending. The handoff still includes recent local work such as results, lessons, decisions, open risks, incidents, and next steps. If pending memory proposals exist, `continue` prints inspect, apply, and reject commands without blocking the flow.

## Portable Resume Pack

Use `pack resume` when Codex cannot access your local `.briefops` workspace or when you want one markdown file to paste or attach to a fresh thread.

```bash
briefops pack resume \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Continue unresolved slippage checks."
```

Portable packs are self-contained and include continuity context directly. Review packs before sharing outside your local machine. They may include local project memory, decisions, lessons, risks, and worker history.

By default, packs include private memory because pack generation is an explicit local user action. Memory still stores `visibility` and `exportable` metadata for future filtering:

```bash
briefops memory add \
  --type lessons \
  --content "Always verify turnover warning threshold." \
  --visibility shared \
  --exportable
```

Defaults:

```yaml
visibility: private
exportable: false
```

BriefOps does not add cloud sync or encryption.

## Local Memory Queue And Skill Patches

`briefops finish` applies durable memory locally by default. Pending memory proposals still exist for audit/review mode and older workspaces.

Use explicit proposal commands when you choose to inspect the queue:

```bash
briefops memory proposal-show latest
briefops memory proposal-apply latest
briefops memory proposal-reject latest

briefops skill patch-show latest
briefops skill apply-patch risk-review --patch latest
briefops skill reject-patch latest
```

The convenience approval command remains available for pending queue items:

```bash
briefops approve latest
briefops approve memory latest
briefops approve skill-patch latest
```

`briefops approve <id|latest>` tries memory first. If no matching memory proposal exists, it tries a skill patch. It applies at most one item. Skill patches should be applied only with explicit user direction.

## Inbox

Use `inbox` to see pending memory proposals, skill patches, open risks, stale or deprecated memory counts, and recommended next commands.

```bash
briefops inbox
briefops inbox --project atlas-q
briefops inbox --worker quant-reviewer
briefops inbox --skill risk-review
```

`inbox` is read-only. It does not mutate files.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Is | Stored At |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | Reusable task protocol | `.briefops/skills/*.skill.md` |
| Project | Durable project facts and constraints | `.briefops/projects/*.project.md` |
| Worker | Persistent skill bundle and judgment profile | `.briefops/workers/*.worker.yaml` |
| Worker Summary | Refreshed worker intelligence | `.briefops/workers/summaries/*.summary.md` |
| Work Log | Completed task record | `.briefops/logs/*.yaml` |
| Memory | Curated facts, decisions, lessons, incidents | `.briefops/memory/*.yaml` |
| Memory Proposal | Audit/review memory candidate | `.briefops/memory-proposals/*.yaml` |
| Skill Patch | Explicit-review skill improvement | `.briefops/patches/*.patch.yaml` |
| Handoff | Fresh-thread continuity brief | `.briefops/handoffs/*.md` |
| Codex Prompt | Mission or resume prompt | `.briefops/codex/prompts/*.md` |
| Portable Pack | Self-contained resume markdown | `.briefops/codex/prompts/*resume-pack*.md` |
| Eval | Deterministic checklist case | `.briefops/evals/*.eval.yaml` |

## Memory

Manual memory add:

```bash
briefops memory add \
  --type lessons \
  --project atlas-q \
  --skill risk-review \
  --content "Always verify turnover warning threshold when rebalance logic changes." \
  --tags "rebalance,turnover,risk"
```

Memory types:

- `facts`
- `decisions`
- `lessons`
- `incidents`
- `deprecated`

Statuses:

- `active`
- `stale`
- `deprecated`
- `superseded`
- `archived`

Visibility:

- `private`
- `shared`
- `public`

List, show, and update memory:

```bash
briefops memory list
briefops memory list --project atlas-q --status active
briefops memory show <memory-id>
briefops memory update-status <memory-id> --status archived
```

Promote useful work-log items through a proposal. `briefops finish` does this automatically by default; these commands are for manual or review-mode flows:

```bash
briefops memory propose-from-log latest
briefops memory proposal-list --status proposed
briefops memory proposal-show <proposal-id|latest>
briefops memory proposal-apply <proposal-id|latest>
briefops memory proposal-reject <proposal-id|latest>
```

Extraction is deterministic and local. Lessons, decisions, incidents, open risks, prefixed notes, and policy-like next steps can become proposal items. Proposal generation and application are local file-backed operations protected by workspace locks.

## Skills And Skill Patches

Create and inspect skills:

```bash
briefops skill create risk-review
briefops skill list
briefops skill show risk-review
briefops skill history risk-review
```

Propose, review, apply, or reject skill patches:

```bash
briefops skill propose-patch --skill risk-review --from-log latest
briefops skill patch-list
briefops skill patch-show <patch-id|latest>
briefops skill apply-patch risk-review --patch <patch-id|latest>
briefops skill reject-patch <patch-id|latest>
```

Skill patches are generated from work-log lessons and are never auto-applied.

## Projects And Workers

Projects:

```bash
briefops project create atlas-q
briefops project list
briefops project show atlas-q
```

Workers:

```bash
briefops worker create quant-reviewer --project atlas-q --skills "risk-review"
briefops worker list
briefops worker show quant-reviewer
briefops worker refresh-summary quant-reviewer
briefops worker intelligence quant-reviewer
briefops worker inspect quant-reviewer
```

Use a worker for fresh-thread continuity:

```bash
briefops codex mission --worker quant-reviewer --task "Review this PR." --mode loop --save
briefops continue --worker quant-reviewer --task "Continue prior work." --pack
```

## Briefs, Handoffs, And Codex Prompts

Generate a plain brief:

```bash
briefops brief generate \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Review this PR for risk policy violations." \
  --adapter codex
```

Generate a handoff:

```bash
briefops handoff generate \
  --project atlas-q \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Continue unresolved slippage checks." \
  --save
```

Add `--export-policy shared-only` to handoff or Codex resume output when the artifact may leave the local workspace. Shared-only handoffs, resumes, and packs omit private continuity content and private metadata counts.

Generate a Codex resume prompt:

```bash
briefops codex resume \
  --worker quant-reviewer \
  --task "Continue unresolved slippage checks." \
  --from-handoff latest \
  --mode loop \
  --save
```

List and inspect saved artifacts:

```bash
briefops brief list
briefops brief show latest
briefops brief inspect latest

briefops handoff list
briefops handoff show latest
briefops handoff inspect latest
```

## Inspect, Doctor, And Evals

```bash
briefops doctor
briefops doctor --stability
briefops doctor --privacy
briefops doctor --security
briefops doctor --security --fix-stale-locks
briefops inspect workspace
briefops inspect memory
briefops inspect tokens --worker quant-reviewer --task "Review this PR." --budget 2500
briefops inspect retrieval --project atlas-q --worker quant-reviewer --task "Continue slippage checks."
briefops inspect continuity --project atlas-q --worker quant-reviewer
```

`doctor --stability` is read-only and bounded: it reports counts plus a small set of examples instead of dumping workspace contents. `doctor --security --fix-stale-locks` removes stale locks only; it does not remove fresh locks or other workspace files.

Evals are deterministic checklist checks. They do not call an LLM judge.

```bash
briefops eval create turnover-missing-case \
  --skill risk-review \
  --project atlas-q \
  --input "Review rebalance logic." \
  --expected "turnover warning threshold"

briefops eval run --skill risk-review --project atlas-q
briefops eval list
briefops eval show turnover-missing-case
```

## Token Budget Philosophy

BriefOps uses a deterministic estimate:

```text
estimated_tokens = ceil(character_count / 4)
```

When generated briefs, handoffs, or resumes are too large, BriefOps trims lower-priority context while preserving the task and core continuity contract. If a portable pack exceeds the requested budget, BriefOps prints a warning and preserves core continuity content.

## File Structure

`briefops init` creates:

```text
.briefops/
+-- config.yaml
+-- skills/
+-- projects/
+-- memory/
|   +-- facts.yaml
|   +-- decisions.yaml
|   +-- lessons.yaml
|   +-- incidents.yaml
|   +-- deprecated.yaml
+-- memory-proposals/
+-- workers/
|   +-- summaries/
+-- logs/
+-- handoffs/
+-- briefs/
+-- codex/
|   +-- prompts/
|       +-- prime.md
|       +-- mission.md
|       +-- plan.md
+-- evals/
|   +-- results/
+-- patches/
+-- templates/
    +-- brief.generic.md
    +-- brief.codex.md
    +-- brief.claude-code.md
```

By default `.briefops/` is ignored by git in this repository. This keeps local operational memory out of public commits unless you intentionally choose otherwise.

Because `.briefops/` is local/private, Codex does not automatically see it. Provide a saved Codex resume prompt or portable resume pack when starting a fresh thread that needs prior worker context.

```

## Troubleshooting

Workspace not found:

```bash
briefops init
```

Optional pending memory before continuing:

```bash
briefops memory proposal-list --status proposed
briefops memory proposal-show latest
briefops memory proposal-apply latest
```

Need a fresh thread without `.briefops` access:

```bash
briefops continue --worker <worker> --task "<task>" --pack
```

Brief or resume is too long:

```bash
briefops inspect tokens --worker <worker> --task "<task>" --budget 2500
```

Check continuity health:

```bash
briefops inspect continuity --project <project> --worker <worker>
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

Run the CLI in development:

```bash
npm run dev -- --help
```
